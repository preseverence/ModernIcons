# Modern Icons

Modern Icons are targetted at those implementing the Modern Design Language in their applications.

Coming Soon: [ModernIcons.io](http://modernicons.io)

## Optimization

While the source icons in the repo are optimized far greater than the stock MDL2 font provided in Windows 10, they are not compressed. Please go to ModernIcons.io to download compressed SVG icons and fonts.

## Color Pallet

The color pallet is sampled from all the icons used in all the Universal Applications.

## About This Fork

The only change a made is automated png preview generation.

# License

Coming Soon... something open source that retains the 'Modern Icons' naming, but allows Individual and Commercial use.
